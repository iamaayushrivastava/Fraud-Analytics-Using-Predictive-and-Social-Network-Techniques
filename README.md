## Introduction

This repository is designed to explore various advanced techniques for fraud detection, including clustering algorithms, graph-based ranking methods, cost-sensitive regression models, and deep learning techniques. By utilizing these methods, you can enhance your fraud detection capabilities and effectively mitigate fraudulent activities.

## Assignment

### Cluster Identification

For this task, you will identify clusters within a dataset using different embedding techniques. The following methods will be implemented:

1. **Node2Vec Embedding**
2. **Spectral Clustering**
3. **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**

These methods will help you uncover patterns and group similar instances together, facilitating the detection of anomalous behavior indicative of fraud.

### Implementation of Trust Rank

Trust Rank will be implemented using the Pregel framework. Trust Rank is a graph-based ranking algorithm that helps in identifying trustworthy nodes within a network. By leveraging the Pregel framework, you can efficiently compute the Trust Rank scores for each node in a large-scale graph.

### Example-dependent Cost-sensitive Regression

This task involves implementing example-dependent cost-sensitive regression based on the approach by AC Bahnsen and Nikou Gunnemann. This method adjusts the regression model to account for varying costs associated with different types of errors, improving the overall effectiveness of the fraud detection model.

### Fraud Detection Using Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder

Two deep-learning techniques will be employed for fraud detection:

1. **Autoencoder**: This neural network architecture is used to learn a compressed representation of the data, and any significant deviations from the reconstructed data can indicate fraud.
2. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: VAEs add a probabilistic twist to autoencoders, enabling them to generate new data samples. They can be used for both anomaly detection and synthetic data generation.

### Synthetic Data Generation Using Variational Autoencoder

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) will be utilized to generate synthetic data that mimics the properties of the original dataset. This synthetic data can be used to augment training datasets, helping to improve model robustness and performance.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamaayushrivastava/Fraud-Analytics-Using-Predictive-and-Social-Network-Techniques.git
   cd Fraud-Analytics-Using-Predictive-and-Social-Network-Techniques
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
